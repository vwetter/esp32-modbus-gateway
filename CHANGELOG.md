## [1.2.2] - 2025-11-01

### Added
- **Error Counter Reset** - New "Reset Errors" button in Web UI statistics card
- HTTP API endpoint `POST /api/errors/reset` to reset error counter (persists to NVS)
- Improved Modbus timing for better evcc compatibility

### Changed
- Code cleanup - removed temporary debug outputs
- Enhanced MAX485 timing:
  - Increased DE/RE switch delays (before and after TX: 100Âµs â†’ 500Âµs)
  - Added critical 2ms delay after `setDE(false)` for RX mode switching
  - More thorough UART buffer clearing before transmission
  - Added 75ms post-transaction delay for rapid request stability
- Increased Modbus RTU RX timeout from 1000ms to 2000ms
- Increased inter-frame delay from 10ms to 50ms

### Fixed
- **"No response" errors with evcc** - resolved timing issues with rapid Modbus polling
- MAX485 RX/TX mode switching race condition
- Improved reliability for consecutive Modbus requests

### Commits
- 3cc2fae â€” Add HTTP POST handler for /api/errors/reset
- a2772a1 â€” Update esp32-modbus-gateway.ino with UI improvements
- e38d542 â€” Code cleanup and version bump


## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added
- **ðŸš€ WiFi Manager functionality** - Major feature for generic deployments
- Auto Access Point mode on first boot (`AP-modbus-gw`, password: `initpass`)
- Web-based WiFi configuration interface with network scanning
- WiFi credentials stored in NVS (Non-Volatile Storage)
- WiFi reset functionality via web interface
- Automatic fallback to AP mode when WiFi connection fails
- Mobile-friendly setup interface with responsive design
- WiFi network scanning with RSSI and encryption status
- Generic firmware deployment (no code changes needed for different networks)
- Enhanced status API with WiFi configuration information

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed hardcoded WiFi credentials (`WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASS`)
- Access Point SSID changed to `AP-modbus-gw` (was `ESP32-ModbusGW`)
- Access Point password changed to `initpass` (was `12345678`)
- Boot sequence now checks for saved WiFi configuration
- Web interface serves different pages based on configuration state
- Factory reset now also clears WiFi configuration
- Enhanced troubleshooting documentation

### Fixed
- Improved WiFi connection reliability with timeout handling
- Better error handling for WiFi setup process
- Enhanced logging for WiFi connection states

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-22

### Added
- **Persistent configuration storage** using ESP32 NVS (Non-Volatile Storage)
- UART settings now persist across reboots and power cycles
- Request/error counter tracking stored persistently
- Factory reset functionality via web UI and API
- Configuration section at top of code for easy customization
- OTA hostname and password configurable in code header
- Progress logging during OTA updates
- Better structured configuration constants

### Changed
- Moved OTA settings to configuration section (top of file)
- WiFi hostname now uses OTA_HOSTNAME for consistency
- Improved `initOTA()` function to use configuration constants
- Enhanced error messages in OTA callbacks

### Fixed
- Function declaration order (addLog forward declaration)
- UART config now saves immediately when changed
- Statistics persist across reboots

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- Initial release
- Modbus TCP to RTU bridge
- Embedded web interface
- REST API
- OTA updates
- Real-time logging
- Multiple function code support (01-06, 0F, 10)
- RS485 direction control (DE/RE)
- CRC validation
- Multiple simultaneous TCP connections
